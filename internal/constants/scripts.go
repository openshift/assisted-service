// PreNetworkConfigScript script runs on hosts before network manager service starts in order to apply
// user's provided network configuration on the host.
// If the user provides static network configuration, the network config files will be stored in directory
// /etc/assisted/network in the following structure:
// /etc/assisted/network/
//                    +-- host1
//                    |      +--- *.nmconnection
//                    |      +--- mac_interface.ini
//                    +-- host2
//                          +--- *.nmconnection
//                          +--- mac_interface.ini
// 1. *.nmconnections - files generated by nmstate based on yaml files provided by the user
// 2. mac_interface.ini - the file contains mapping of mac-address to logical interface name.
//    There are two usages for the file:
//    1. Map logical interface name to MAC Address of the host. The logical interface name is a
//       name provided by the user for the interface. It will be replaced by the script with the
//       actual network interface name.
//    2. Identify the host directory which belongs to the current host by matching a MAC Address
//       from the mapping file with host network interfaces.
//
// Applying the network configuration of each host will be done by:
// 1. Associate the current host with its matching hostX directory. The association will be done by
//    matching host's mac addresses with those in mac_interface.ini.
// 2. Replace logical interface name in nmconnection files with the interface name as set on the host
// 3. Rename nmconnection files to start with the interface name (instead of the logical interface name)
// 4. Copy the nmconnection files to /NetworkManager/system-connections/
