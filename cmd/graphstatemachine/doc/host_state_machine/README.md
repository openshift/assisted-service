### Disconnected
Hosts reach this state when the agent stops communicating with the service for a period of time. This can happen if the host is rebooted, if the agent is stopped for some reason, or if the host lost connectivity. Hosts can also reach this state if the agent that runs them detects and reports that the virtual media serving the live ISO doesn't seem to be responding

* [Register non-rebooting host in resetting](#register-non-rebooting-host-in-resetting)

### Error
Hosts can reach this state in many ways when something goes wrong and there's nothing the service or the user can do to remedy the situation. For example, when the cluster state machine goes into error, all hosts within the cluster will also go into error. The only way to get a host out of this state is by resetting the cluster installation. It is possible that a cluster installation would be considered successful even when some of the hosts reach this state, for example when the host that reached this state is a worker and there are other workers that are sufficient for healthy cluster operation

### Installing in Progress
Hosts stay in this state for a long time while they're being installed. The actual host installation progress is tracked via the host's progress stages, percentage and messages rather than moving the hosts to different states

### Installing, Pending User Action
Hosts in this state are waiting for the user to perform some action before the installation can continue. For example, when the host boots into the discovery ISO after it has been rebooted by the Assisted Installer - the user must manually reboot the host into the installation disk

### Preparing for Installation
A transient state which occurs after the user triggers installation and before installation actually begins. This state was made for performing destructive validations such as disk speed check. We don't perform those validations in prior states because before the user clicks install, we don't have their consent to perform disk writes. If those validations fail, we do not continue with the installation process

### Resetting
Hosts reach this state when the user triggers a reset of the cluster installation. When ENABLE_AUTO_RESET is set to false (which it always is), this is a very short lived state and the host immediately proceeds to 'Resetting, Pending User Action' from it. This is a legacy state and it should eventually be merged with 'Resetting, Pending User Action'

### Initial registration
When new host is first registered. This transition is not executed on unbound hosts because <unknown, TODO>

#### Source states
* [Initial](#initial)

#### Destination state
[Discovering](#discovering)

### Re-registration
When the host attempts to register while it's in one of the non-installation states. We move the host back to the discovering state instead of keeping it in its current state because we consider it a new host with potentially different hardware. See PostRegisterHost function

#### Source states
* [Discovering](#discovering)

#### Destination state

### Ignore register while rebooting host in resetting
On such cases cluster monitor is responsible to set the host state to resetting-pending-user-action. There are some edge cases on installation where user tries to reset installation on the same time reboot is called. On some cases the agent will get to reset itself and register again just before the reboot and the cluster monitor will not get to set the status in resetting-pending-user-action on time. Created to prevent OCPBUGSM-13597

#### Source states
* [Resetting](#resetting)

#### Destination state
[Resetting](#resetting)

### Register non-rebooting host in resetting
The opposite of the 'Ignore register while rebooting host in resetting' transition rule, move host to discovering

#### Source states
* [Resetting](#resetting)

#### Destination state
[Discovering](#discovering)

### Wrong boot order detection
A day-1 host trying to register while it's in the rebooting stage or a day-2 host trying to register while it's in the done stage indicate that the host, after installing the operating system to disk and then rebooting, booted from the discovery ISO again instead of booting the installed operating system as it should've done (the first thing the discovery ISO live OS tries to do is register). This indicates that the user has a wrong boot order that they should fix. This transition makes sure to let the user know about what happened and what they should do to fix that

* [Installing, Pending User Action](#installing-pending-user-action)
* [Added to Existing Cluster](#added-to-existing-cluster)

#### Destination state
[Installing, Pending User Action](#installing-pending-user-action)

### Register during installation
Any host registering during installation but doesn't match the 'Wrong boot order detection' transition is performing an invalid operation and thus should move to the error state

#### Source states
* [Installing](#installing)
* [Installing in Progress](#installing-in-progress)

#### Destination state
[Error](#error)

### Register during error
Host in error should be able to register without changes. If the registration return conflict or error then we have infinite number of events. If the registration is blocked (403) it will break auto-reset feature. It can happen that user rebooted the host manually after installation failure without changes in the cluster. So the best option is just accept the registration without changes in the DB

#### Source states
* [Error](#error)

#### Destination state
[Error](#error)

### Register post-installation
A host may boot from the installation ISO after the cluster has been installed. In that case we want to ask the host to go away, as otherwise it will flood the log and the events
