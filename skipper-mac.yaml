# The host network is unsupported for "Docker for desktop" (which is used in macOS) but it partially works.
# For example: creating a new Nginx container with the "host" network using the command "docker run --net host nginx"
# doesn't open the 80 port on the host and you won't be able to access the service on the host using localhost:80.
# From the container, it's possible to access the host ports,
# For example create an nginx container using the command: "docker run -p 80:80 nginx"
# Now create a new container using the command: "docker run -it --net host centos curl http://localhost:80/"
# The centos container can access the Nginx page although it is published to the host.

# The unit-test makefile target starts a new Postgres container and publishes its port to the host.
# There is three options to access the Postgres DB:
# 1. Create a new container on the "host" network and access it at localhost:5432
# 2. Create a new container and access it at host.docker.internal:5432
# 3. Access the container directly container:5432
# We choose the first option since using the other options required a lot of changes
