  # By default, SMT (or hyperthreading) is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. 
  # Therefore, you can omit this section unless you wish to disable hyperthreading. 
  # You can disable SMT by setting the parameter value to 'Disabled'. Then, you must disable it in all cluster machines; 
  # this includes both control plane and compute machines.
