# Enhancements Tracking for Assisted Installer

Inspired by the [Kubernetes enhancement](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements) process.

This directory provides a rally point to discuss, debate, and reach consensus
for how Assisted Installer (AI) enhancements are introduced. Given that the AI
is composed of multiple projects: assisted-service, assisted-installer, and
assisted-installer-agent to name a few, it is useful to have a centralized
place to describe AI enhancements via an actionable design proposal.

## Should I Create an Enhancement?

A rough heuristic for an enhancement is anything that:

* impacts multiple Assisted Installer projects
* requires significant effort to complete
* requires consensus across multiple domains of Assisted Installer
* impacts the UX or operation of Assisted Installer substantially
* users of Assisted Installer will notice and come to rely on

A rough heuristic for when an enhancement should be made in
openshift/enhancements instead:

* requires changes to OpenShift
* requires changes and/or consensus with other components related to
  OpenShift
* substantially impacts the requirements for and/or experience of installing and
  provisioning OpenShift
* would benefit from approval by OpenShift architects

It is unlikely to require an enhancement if it:

* is covered by an existing OpenShift enhancement proposal
* fixes a bug
* adds more testing
* internally refactors a code or component only visible to that components domain
* minimal impact to Assisted Installer as a whole
