# Hive Integration - Conditions

Conditions provide a standard mechanism for higher-level status reporting from a controller. Read more about conditions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties)

## AgentClusterInstall Conditions

AgentClusterInstall supported condition types are: `SpecSynced`, `RequirementsMet`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Stopped` and `Validated`.
