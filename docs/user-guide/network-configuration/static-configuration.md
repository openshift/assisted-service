# Static Network Configuration

User may provide static network configurations when generating or updating the discovery ISO.

## NMState

NMStateConfig is a declarative way of managing configuration of networking settings. A general introduction to the NMState can be found in the [upstream documentation](https://nmstate.io/examples.html) whereas the [Hive Integration readme](../../hive-integration/README.md#NMStateConfig) explains how to use it together with the Assisted Service.

## Sample KubeAPI CR

[This sample CR](../../hive-integration/crds/nmstate.yaml) shows how to create a custom NMStateConfig to be used with Assisted Service on-premises.
:stop_sign: Note that due to the ignition content length limit (`256Ki`), there is a limit to the amount of NMStateConfigs that can be included with a single InfraEnv. With a config sample such as [this one](../../hive-integration/crds/nmstate.yaml), the limit per each InfraEnv is 3960 configurations.

## REST API

The static network configurations per each host should contain:

* NMState file in YAML format, specifying the desired network configuration for the host. The file will contain interface logical names that will be replaced with host's actual interface name at discovery time
* A map (mac-interface-mapping) containing the mapping of mac-address to the logical interface name

In the following example `server-a.yaml` and `server-b.yaml` files contain the nmstate configuration in YAML format for two nodes. Here is an example of the content of `server-a.yaml`, setting network configuration for two of its network interfaces:

```yaml
dns-resolver:
  config:
    server:
    - 192.168.126.1
interfaces:
- ipv4:
    address:
    - ip: 192.168.126.30
      prefix-length: 24
    dhcp: false
    enabled: true
  name: eth0
  state: up
  type: ethernet
- ipv4:
    address:
    - ip: 192.168.141.30
      prefix-length: 24
    dhcp: false
    enabled: true
  name: eth1
  state: up
  type: ethernet
routes:
  config:
  - destination: 0.0.0.0/0
    next-hop-address: 192.168.126.1
    next-hop-interface: eth0
    table-id: 254
```

The `mac-interface-mapping` attribute should map the MAC Addresses of the host to the logical interface name as used in the `network_yaml` element (nmstate files):

```yaml
mac_interface_map: [
    {
      mac_address: 02:00:00:2c:23:a5,
      logical_nic_name: eth0
    },
    {
      mac_address: 02:00:00:68:73:dc,
      logical_nic_name: eth1
    }
]
```

In order to use `curl` to send a request for setting static network configuration in an existing infra-env, there is a need to JSON-encode the content of those files. This can be achieved using the `jq` tool as shown below

```sh
jq -n --arg SSH_KEY "$NODE_SSH_KEY" --arg NMSTATE_YAML1 "$(cat server-a.yaml)" --arg NMSTATE_YAML2 "$(cat server-b.yaml)" \
'{
  "static_network_config": [
    {
      "network_yaml": $NMSTATE_YAML1,
      "mac_interface_map": [{"mac_address": "02:00:00:2c:23:a5", "logical_nic_name": "eth0"}, {"mac_address": "02:00:00:68:73:dc", "logical_nic_name": "eth1"}]
    },
    {
      "network_yaml": $NMSTATE_YAML2,
      "mac_interface_map": [{"mac_address": "02:00:00:9f:85:eb", "logical_nic_name": "eth1"}, {"mac_address": "02:00:00:c8:be:9b", "logical_nic_name": "eth0"}]
     }
  ]
}' >> $request_body
```

The request will be stored in a temporary file `$request_body` and will be used as the request body of the `curl` command:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PATCH -d @$request_body ${ASSISTED_SERVICE_URL}/api/assisted-install/v2/infra-envs/$INFRA_ENV_ID
```
