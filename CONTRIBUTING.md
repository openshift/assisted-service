# Contribute to the Assisted Installer Project

## Template

Every PR should fill in the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE] which is automatically proposed by GitHub when creating a new PR.

## How to commit?

We enforce contributors behavior with commit messages to reference JIRA/GitHub issues.

### Why?

Organized history and to create a CHANGE LOG for each version.

### How does it work?

[This script](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/blob/master/hack/check-commit-message.sh#L7) checks for a valid issue (JIRA or GitHub) reference and fails the build otherwise with the message

```text
Your commit message should start with a JIRA issue ('JIRA-1111'), a GitHub issue ('#39'), or a BugZilla issue ('Bug 123')
with a following colon(:).
i.e. 'MGMT-42: Summary of the commit message'
You can also ignore the ticket checking with 'NO-ISSUE' for master only.
```

It will search for a commit message containing a valid JIRA/GitHub issue notation or "NO-ISSUE" in case there's no ticket.

### Bugzilla references

The openshift-ci bot looks for `Bug XXX:` in the title of the pull request in order to reference the GitHub PR in the tracker.

### Examples

1. JIRA reference without a Bugzilla link

    ```text
    MGMT-6075: Implement ResetHostValidation API call
    ```

1. No reference

    ```text
    NO-ISSUE: allow GitHub-created reverts to be used
    ```

1. Bugzilla and JIRA reference

    ```text
    Bug 1957227: Allow overriding defaults via provided ConfigMap

    [...]

    Closes: OCPBUGSM-28781
    ```

    **NOTE**: For this commit the following is also correct, but the PR is not automatically linked with the bug tracker. Linking only to Bugzilla without referencing JIRA is not correct.

    ```text
    OCPBUGSM-28781: Allow overriding defaults via provided ConfigMap
    ```

1. GitHub reference

    ```text
    #1 Fixing the very first GitHub issue
    ```

    **NOTE**: The following is also correct

    ```text
    Fixing the very first GitHub issue

    [...]

    Closes: #1
    ```
