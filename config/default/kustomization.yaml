# Enables assisted-service startup to create a route for the service
# through an init container. This used by in-cluster deployments so that 
# a route to the service is created and the SERVICE_BASE_URL is updated 
# to match the route's URL.

# TODO: Remove when filesystem is ready
# Uncomment to set the DEPLOY_TARGET to "k8s". By default the DEPLOY_TARGET
# for OCP clusters should be "ocp". For the "ocp" target we are aiming to use
# s3 filesystem implementation. At the moment the switch to the s3 filesystem
# implementation is not complete. In the interim, scality is deployed by the
# operator and for assisted-service to be functional you will need to use "k8s"
# as the DEPLOY_TARGET.
